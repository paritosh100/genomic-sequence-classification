Adenine pairs with thymine while guanine pairs with cytosine due to their specialized chemical structures that allow them to fit together on the rungs of the DNA helical ladder. Together, this intricately structured DNA molecule provides the instructions for all living cells to be able to survive, function, and reproduce.\n",

    "Living organisms, especially multicellular, eukaryotic organisms are highly complex, so you can imagine that the DNA coding sequence within organisms, although only comprised of four bases, is very, very long. The size of the genome (genome = the genetic material in an organism) ranges widely among different eukaryotic organisms. Budding yeast have 12 million base pairs in their genome; the human genome is about 3 billion base pairs long; and the largest known genome size is that of a rare Japanese flower, Paris japonica, at a mind-blowing 150 billion base pairs long! If the DNA from a single cell of this flower were stretched out, it would measure to be about 300 feet from end-to-end! And that's just in a single cell! Humans have over 30 trillion cells in their body - the sheer amount of DNA within any single living organism is truly staggering!\n",

    "Thankfully, biotechnology has advanced a lot in the past couple decades, and today next-generation sequencing allows for large-scale determination of the gene sequence from a DNA sample. While previously sequencing a genome required a lot of time and resources (the Human Genome Project was a 13-year project, from 1990 to 2003, that took about $1,000,000,000 to sequence the entire human genome), next-generation sequencing allows for whole genome sequencing in just a day for a few thousand dollars. This means that we can analyze the whole genome sequence if we desire - of course we'd have to then look at 3 billion base pairs of genetic code, but this is a lot easier to work with using Python libraries, such as Pandas. So let's jump in and get our hands on some DNA!"

Taking a look at the original data file downloaded from the directory, we can see that there are millions and millions of coded sequences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the file, with 'N' appearing only minimally towards the start and the end of the sequence.

This is a result of error in the sequencer and there's not much we can do about the missing data since we don't have raw chromatograph files to analyze the DNA sequence interpretation by eye. Chromatographs show the sequencing results for each position in the DNA, i.e. the sequencer's interpretation of what the base at each position is (this is determined based on chemical signals exuded by each base while sequencing).

The genetic code dictates that the nucleotides of mRNA are read in triplets, called **codons**. There are 61 possible codons with the four mRNA nucleotides. You might be wondering, how then, there are only twenty amino acids. Multiple codons can encode the same amino acid. One of the codons (AUG) is the start codon, where translation of the mRNA begins to create a specific protein. Three codons are stop codons (UGA, UAG, and UAA), where translation of a specific protein terminates. In this way, large segments of DNA on chromosomes (**genes**) encode the information required to synthesize tens of thousands of specialized proteins in the body. There are estimated to be between 200 and 300 genes on chromosome 21, but one gene can encode lots of proteins.\n"

There are many complexities with DNA sequencing and the flow of genetic information through central dogma that are missed with this simplistic approach. There are other initiation factors and proteins that are involved in protein synthesis, so that not all the protein sequences we found may actually be translated from this chromosome in actual cells. Additionally, not all regions of the mRNA correspond to particular amino acids. An area near the 5' end known as the untranslated region (UTR) which has a ribosome binding site required for the process of protein synthesis, but doesn't affect the sequence of amino acids.\n",

While there are still thousands of proteins that we synthesized from the DNA and mRNA sequences (and chromosome 21 has been found to only have between 200 and 300 genes), it is highly unlikely that there would be such a huge number of proteins encoded on the smallest chromosome in the human genome."

    "Like mentioned previously, the encoding of genetic information, gene expression, and protein synthesis along the central dogma of molecular biology is very complex, and we'd need to go into a much deeper biology-focused and detailed approach in order to gain a higher level of understanding of the genetic information encoded in the DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is a large amount of openly available genetic sequence information in various genome databases. Besides from the FASTA format of raw genetic sequence, lots of other sequencing formats provide various kinds of information, from numbers of genes already detailed in the data files, for example, to additional information on proteins, and much more. There's a vast pool of genetic information that can be explored and analyzed, and hopefully this tutorial was a nice first stepping stone into your exploration of genomics and has peaked your curiosity to explore further. Happy learning!"
